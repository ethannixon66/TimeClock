Missing Features:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Clock that shows at all times (due to limitations with the text user interface, constantly refreshing the display to show the time can cause issues)
  - Overtime (due to shifts having no prescribed length and all shifts being treated as separate and unrelated even within the same week, overtime is not able to be implemented currently)
  - Encryption or other protection of any stored data
